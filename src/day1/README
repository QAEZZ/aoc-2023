Advent of Code 2023 - Day 1
===========================

The calibration process involves concatenating the first and last digits on each line, 
resulting in the calibration number.

Example:
- `1abc2` --> 1 + 2 = 12
- `pqr3stu8vwx` --> 3 + 8 = 38
- `a1b2c3d4e5f` --> 1 + 5 = 15
- `treb7uchet` --> 7 + 7 = 77 (since there is only one digit, seven is both the first and last digit)
