# The first digit to appear and the last digit to appear    #
# gets concatenated, the sum of the all concatenated is the #
# calibration number.                                       #

# Part One                                                  #
# ========================================================= #
# Example:                                                  #
# 1abc2 --------> 1 + 2 = 12                                #
# pqr3stu8vwx --> 3 + 8 = 38                                #
# a1b2c3d4e5f --> 1 + 5 = 15                                #
# treb7uchet ---> 7 + 7 = 77 | Since there is only one      #
#                            | digit, seven is the          #
#                            | first and last digit.        #
# ========================================================= #
# Part Two                                                  #
# ========================================================= #
# Little different for part two, same concept as part one   #
# however, we must also take into account that the digits   #
# can be in word form. i.e. one, two, seven, etc.           #
#                                                           #
# With that in mind, the website says that it only uses one #
# through nine. No need to worry about digits > 9 nor < 1.  #
#                                                           #
# Example:                                                  #
# two1nine -----> two + nine = 29                           #
# eightwothree -> eight + two + three = 823                 #
# abone2threex -> one + 2 + three = 123                     #
# 7pqtsixteen --> 7 + six = 76                              #
